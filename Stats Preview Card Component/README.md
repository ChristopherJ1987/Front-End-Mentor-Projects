## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

I am using the images provided in the design folder for screenshot images. When I used my own screenshots they all had different sizes and warped the grid i had layed out on my homepage. The images provided in the design folder are close enough to what I have made to not notice the difference, and allow a more pleasing user experience.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Useful Resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - Just a really nice reference for the how to use the picture tag in HTML.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-rid-of-the-gap-under-the-image/) - I found this to help me get rid of some white space under my picture tag, and it was literally just making the css selector display: block;.
- [DEV](https://dev.to/ellen_dev/two-ways-to-achieve-an-image-colour-overlay-with-css-eio) - I was having a hard time figuring out what I needed to do about the overlay color, and this gave me an interesting way to approach the problem that I wasn't thinking of.
