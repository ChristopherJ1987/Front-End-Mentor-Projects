## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Useful Resources

- [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - I have used this link in almost every project to horizontally and vertically center a div so I thought I would put it in the resource section whil I was thinking about it with this project.
- [Webflow](https://discourse.webflow.com/t/how-to-change-svg-colors/114001) - This showed me how to alter the svg code slightly so I can change the fill color.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/) - This was a great resource for helping me get the box shadow I wanted.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
